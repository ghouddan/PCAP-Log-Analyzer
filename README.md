# SOC PCAP Analyzer

A lightweight Python tool designed to help detect common network-based security events from packet capture (PCAP) files.

This tool is intended for junior SOC analysts and security learners. It supports `.pcap` and `.pcapng` formats and performs basic detections such as brute force login attempts, port scans, and large data exfiltration.

---

## Features

### Brute Force Detection
Detects repeated connection attempts from the same IP within a short time window.
This is useful for identifying potential brute force attacks on services like SSH,RDP or FTP.

### Port Scan Detection (vertical, horizontal)
Flags IPs that attempt connections on multiple ports in a short timeframe.

### Large Data Transfer Detection
Identifies hosts sending large amounts of data, potentially indicating data exfiltration.

### Output as JSON Report
Structured output that summarizes suspicious activity.

## How to Use

```bash
python3 pcap_analyzer.py \
  --file ./samples/example.pcapng \
  --output ./report.json \
  --brute-threshold 10 \
  --scan-threshold 15 \
  --scan-window 60 \
````

## Sample Use Cases

-  Detect SSH brute-force attacks in internal traffic
- Identify possible port scanning or reconnaissance behavior
- Flag potential data exfiltration from compromised hosts

---

## PCAPs Tested

-  Sample captures generated with Kali Linux tools (Hydra, Nmap)
-  Public PCAPs from online security datasets
-  Custom simulated PCAPs

---

## Motivation

This project was built to simulate the type of network traffic analysis done in real-world SOC environments. It helped me gain hands-on experience with packet inspection, detection logic, and building CLI tools for cybersecurity tasks.
